# basicCode
Basically, The code is to manage a Products module in INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
The Two files, program.cs contains main method and options which are going to reflect in products.json and category.json. 
The Two file, Product.json and Category.Json are json file which contain details of types of products and categories.
I have used Lists and Files to perform operations on data.
